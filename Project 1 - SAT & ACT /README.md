### Overview

I needed to understand what I was going to do for this project. I was going to take a look at how to aggregate SAT & ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States through the years of 2017 & 2018 for both exams. I needed to identify trends in the data & combine my data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates & scores in various states.

My hypothesis:

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - I am part of a team that tracks statewide participation & recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. My presentation & report is geared toward non-technical executives with the College Board. I will use the provided data & outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a state of my choice.


### Deliverables

For this project, I will be providing a few deliverables that will showcase what I decided to study, infer, and discover from the data sets. This will be my proof or evidence for my statistical analysis of the project. Below I have listed all deliverables that you will expect to see:

- Jupyter Notebook that encompasses:
  - All of my Python code
  - All graphs created from the Python code of the data sets
  - Statistical inferential analysis of the data
- All data sets of the 2017 & 2018 SAT|ACT data
  - Even the data sets that are combined.
- This exact readme file stating background of Project 1
- My presentation in a PDF file format

### Presentation

My presentation will discuss what I had done in this project. I went over what data cleaning is & why it was necessary for these data sets. I had to hone in what my audience was especially since I was presenting this to the college board that will be using my analysis to determine the direction going forward in participation of States & the test takers for increasing scores in certain sections as well as the urge to take either the SAT or ACT exam.

I then provided my problem, what I did which could be perceived as the solution to this problem as well as any graphs that showcase evidence pertaining to participation rates to overall scores & individual scores of sections.
